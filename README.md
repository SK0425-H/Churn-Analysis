Data cleaning- Dividing the tenure column into tenure groups is a common preprocessing step in data cleaning for churn analysis. This transformation simplifies the analysis by categorizing customers based on their tenure, making it easier to identify patterns and trends. 
Deleting the original tenure column, after creating the groups, helps reduce redundancy in the dataset and ensures a more streamlined and efficient analysis process. This process facilitates better insights into the relationship between tenure and churn, contributing to a more effective churn analysis.   ![image](https://github.com/SK0425-H/Churn-Analysis/assets/148009168/863bb892-5912-40f0-bc88-ae97e45aa820)
